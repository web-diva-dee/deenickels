           <p>I graduated from <a href="http://www.siu.edu" target="_blank">Southern Illinois University at Carbondale</a> (SIU-C), College of Technical Careers in Commercial Graphics-Design. This was a well-known program that only accepted 60 students a year with a graduation rate of 50%. It was tough to get in and even tougher to graduate but it produced great talent and I am proud to be among them.</p>

           <p>After graduation, I worked in many ad agencies and marketing firms as an art director, creative director and illustrator. In order to stay marketable in a fast-changing industry, I felt the need to learn some HTML and CSS. What felt like a burden soon became an infectious bug and I loved it. In 2011, I accepted my first front-end developer position.
           </p>

            <p>Currently, I am learning VueJS and continue to polish my vanilla JavaScript skills. In addition to that, I am studying for my <strong>WAS Certification (Web Accessibility Specialist)</strong> and hope to add that to my resume by the end of 2019.
